        <p className='lg:text-2xl text-justify tracking-[0.055em]'>EARTH is the World of Art that Loves, Shares and Expresses Art in its Authenticity. You probably got     that much from the heading, but let’s paint a picture together shall we? Imagine a world where the artist isn’t blocked from creating by the lack of a brush, maybe some paint or even  a room filled with adoring fans waiting for his creative ingenuity to bring colour to their lives. Yes! That world. That world is EARTH.</p>
 
        <p className='lg:text-2xl text-justify tracking-[0.055em]'>We believe the Art World is a place for EVERYONE. That’s why we use technology to create a safe and stress-free environment for the artist to sell his work commission free and for buyers to find art pieces that would bring smiles to their faces, warmth to their hearts and stories to their children. </p>
        
        <p className='lg:text-2xl text-justify tracking-[0.055em]'>And artists who feel like they aren’t seen? We help them find their place in the limelight, making sure that they find the right audience…or the right audience finds them, putting them in a space where their art can speak freely and be heard. Any artist can become seen by the world because we put the spotlight on you.</p>
